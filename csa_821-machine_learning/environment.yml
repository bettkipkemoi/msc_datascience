      # keep pip empty by default; add packages here if desired
      # e.g. - seaborn==0.12.2

# Notes:
# - We pin numpy to 1.25.x to avoid ABI incompatibilities with compiled
#   extensions built against NumPy 1.x (the "_ARRAY_API not found" error).
# - TensorFlow 2.13 is included for neural network examples.
# - conda-forge provides ARM-optimized builds for macOS.
