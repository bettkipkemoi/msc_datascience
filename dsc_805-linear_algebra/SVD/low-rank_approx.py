"""
Goal: Understand how SVD can be used for low-rank approximation of a matrix and its application in noise reduction.

Instructions:

Generate a random matrix A of size 5*5 and add some random noise to it.
Perform SVD on the noisy matrix and use only the top singular values to reconstruct a low-rank approximation of A.
Compare the original matrix, noisy matrix, and the denoised matrix using visualizations and matrix norm calculations (such as the Frobenius norm).
Expected Outcome: A comparison between the noisy matrix and the low-rank approximation, illustrating how SVD can be used for noise reduction.
